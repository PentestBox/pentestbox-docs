Tools Include Policy
=========================

PentestBox currently contains most efficient and popular security tools. I am aware that our users require more tools than provided with PentestBox, that is why we have [Toolsmanager](https://docs.pentestbox.com/#tools-manager) which can be used to install tools which are currently not there in PentestBox. List of tools which can be installed using Toolsmanager can be found at [modules.pentestbox.com](https://modules.pentestbox.com).

If you want to have more tools through toolsmanager then you can let me know the tool name at [Facebook](https://facebook.com/pentestbox), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pentestbox), aditya@manifestsecurity.com or can create a thread on my [todo](https://github.com/pentestbox/todo/issues) list.

But if you would like to suggest some tool which should be included by default in PentestBox, then please make sure it fulfil following points.
* Tool/Software license should allow redistribution of their package.
* If software size is large(more than 300 MB) and it's author already provides windows version of that tool then i won't be able to include it, because it won't be comfortable for the users to download large size installer and plus main motive of PentestBox is to provide security tools which are not compatible on windows by default or their installation is troublesome.

After clearing the above points, if the tool is compatible on windows then i will add it in list for inclusion in next version. But as in the most cases tool is not compatible on windows, then usually i check it's code and see if there is possibility of porting that tool to windows, otherwise i try to contact developer to provide windows support for the tool.
