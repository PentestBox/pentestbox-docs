Sponsoring PentestBox
==========================

Glad to know that you wanted to sponsor PentestBox. 

Your sponsorship will help me make PentestBox more awesome which would ultimately benefit the community. A sponsorship is an annual commitment of funds to the project.

All sponsors will be listed on the project sponsors section at PentestBox.org, ordered by contribution class (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze) with a link back to the sponsor.
* Platinum Sponsors will be listed on the sponsors section and on subdomains(tools.pentestbox.org, modules.pentestbox.org)
* Gold Sponsors will be listed on the sponsors section with a large logo (60k pixel, e.g. 300x200px)
* Silver sponsors will be listed on the sponsors section with a medium size logo (30k pixel, e.g. 200x150px)
* Bronze sponsors will be listed on the sponsors section with a small size logo (6k ixel, e.g. 100x60px)

Sponsors will be able to add the PentestBox logo to their website, which shows that they are a sponsor of PentestBox.

You need to at least commit $100 annually to be listed as a sponsor. 

* Platinum Class: $5000 or above
* Gold class: $1000 or above
* Silver Class: $500 or above
* Bronze class: $100 or above.
