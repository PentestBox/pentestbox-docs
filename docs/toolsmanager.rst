Tools Manager
==========================

Tools Manager was introduced in PentestBox v2.0. Using this utility you can install/update/Uninstall tools which are not there in PentestBox. This makes PentestBox more modular. List of tools which can installed using toolsmanager can be found at `modules.pentestbox.com <https://modules.pentestbox.com>`_.

It is an interactive Installation utility, type **toolsmanager** on terminal to open it. First it will update itself from Github Repository and then will display the menu. In case there is no Internet Connection, script will wait for some time and then display the menu.

You can see list of tools by selecting particular category. For example, if i choose **Web Applications** Category and press **10**, it will display something like this. At the time of writing, it only has **whatweb**.

Now if you want to install **whatweb**, then type **install whatweb** and it will install whatweb. After installing it will display alias for the tool, like in the case of whatweb it is **whatweb**.

..note:: As Toolsmanager is just an installation utility, when any tool without re-distributable license is installed, an user automatically accepts agreement provided by developer of that tool.
