Why Metasploit is not included in PentestBox ?
------------------------------------------------

Metasploit Contains exploits/payloads inside it, so when installed on windows machines nearly all antiviruses and firewalls put up warnings. Also Metasploit officially instruct to disable antiviruses and firewalls while using it.

So in order to make PentestBox work without switching off any antiviruses program, i have not included that. But if you willing to switch off your antiviruses program and want to use Metsaploit on Windows, you can download PentestBox with Metasploit version from the [Download](https://pentestbox.com/#download) option.

Why is PentestBox throwing up red flags with being malware?
--------------------------------------------------------------

* There are two Variants of PentestBox, one without Metasploit and one with Metasploit. Metasploit contains many exploit/payloads, so if you are using version with Metasploit then your antivirus will definetly make warnings. But you don't need to worry about this, it won't infect your system, you can put PentestBox folder in exception list instead of switching off antivirus.
* But if you are using PentestBox version without Metasploit then only some files can be detected as malicious, depending on your antivirus. In my case of Avira below are some of the files detected malicious and it's reason
    * C:/PentestBox/PentestBox.exe: It this is detected then you can use PentestBox.bat file. Although it is just a compiled version of PentestBox.bat file.
    * C:\PentestBox\bin\beef\modules\exploits\local_host\ie_ms12_004_midi\ie_ms12_004_midi.html: It is a part of Beefproject, if deleted then particular modules will not work.

Let me know if you have any concern regarding this issue.
