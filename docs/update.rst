Update Feature
===================

Maintaining a product is always much more important than actually making one. That is why to keep all the tools updated inside PentestBox we have included a update utility. Also i have added ``update config`` which will be used as a medium to fix the bugs if any comes up.
You would see something similar if you would type ``update`` on console.

It will first update itself from it's Github Repository if there are any changes and then display the menu. In case there is no Internet Connection, script will wait for some time and then display the menu.

For example if you need to update your **Web Aplications Tools** then just type **update webapplication**, you can update all the tools in one command by typing **update all**.

How does Update Feature Works in backend ?
-------------------------------------------
PentestBox is an open source project, so all files which are used in PentestBox usage are there on it's `Github Repositories <https://github.com/pentestbox>`_ . 

You can find it's update script `here <https://github.com/pentestbox/scripts/blob/master/update.py>`_ . Nearly 80% of the tools which are shipped in PentestBox are fetched from their respective Github repositories, other are provided in zip format or in other way which are then manually configured in PentestBox. 

Whenever you would type **update** on console, you will see it trying to update something, at the moment it is updating itself. Then whenever you provide a command to update a set of tools, for example ``update webapplication``, it will try to update the tools which are located in ``C:/PentestBox/bin/webapplications/``, as most of the tools are based on git VCS, it requires very less data to acquire changes of the respective tool.
