Update Feature
===================

Maintaining a product is always much more important than actually making one. That is why to keep all the tools updated inside PentestBox we have included a update utility. Also i have added update config which will be used as a medium to fix the bugs if any comes up.
You would see something similar if you would type update on console.

It will first update itself from it's Github Repository if there are any changes and then display the menu. In case there is no Internet Connection, script will wait for some time and then display the menu.

For example if you need to update your **Web Aplications Tools** then just type **update webapplication**, you can update all the tools in one command by typing **update all**.
